Rest in the meaning of these words. When you rise from that meditation, say:
gewa di yi dak sok semchen kün
Through this merit, may my life and the lives of all sentient beings
tsé dir tsering nemé damchö den
Be long, free from illness, and graced with the dharma.
chima dewachen gyi zhing kyé né
In the next life, may we be born in the buddhafield of Great Bliss
tsepakmé gön gopang nyur tob shok
And quickly attain the realisation of the protector Infinite Life.
Say this and other prayers of dedication, aspiration and auspiciousness, then resume your ordinary
activities. Between sessions, always prostrate to and circumambulate supports containing
relics and ringsels, read sūtras, make tsatsas, offer water tormas and so on. In other
words, strive to accomplish virtuous activities.
If you apply yourself to this practice wholeheartedly, all the illnesses, negative influences,
negative karma, obscurations that afflict you will be pacified, and your life, merit and
intelligence will flourish. Your practice will bring you these and other benefits beyond
measure. After you die, you will be reborn in the buddhafield of Great Bliss, where you will
quickly receive the prophecy of your enlightenment – of this there is no doubt!
This prayer is another of the lama’s blessings.Like the nectar that opens utpala flowers,May
the quintessence of the profound meaning Bring all sentient beings the siddhi of immortality!

This prayer was written by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. Maṅgalam bhavatu.3

↑ The Sanskrit translates as: Homage to the Guru and Three Deities of Long Life!↑ The teachings
identify three factors that contribute to keeping us alive: 1) our longevity (tshe), which
is a force or energy that we gain at birth as the result of our previous karma; when
it is “interrupted” by incidental factors, such as an accident or illness, we die; 2) our
life-force (srog), which is the life energy that every sentient being possesses and is responsible
for health and a general sense of well-being; when it is “corrupted” by illness or
spirits, death will follow; and 3) the la-vitality (bla), which is located in the heart
and is responsible for our sense of identification with the body; if it is “scattered” or
leaves the body, death will soon follow.↑ The Sanskrit expression means “May it be auspicious!”
